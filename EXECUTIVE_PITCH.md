- **Manual policy creation** takes 2-6 weeks per service
- **30-60 day security gaps** during policy development
- **Exponential growth** in attack surface

### Threat Velocity
- **New attack vectors** emerge weekly
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities** exploit policy gaps
- **Static policies** can't adapt to dynamic threats
- **Manual updates** lag threat intelligence by days/weeks

### Resource Drain
- **70% of security engineer time** spent on policy boilerplate
- **$500K annual waste** in human capital
- **Strategic defense work** displaced by manual tasks
