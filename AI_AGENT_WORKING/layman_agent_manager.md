# Agent Manager - A Layman's Guide

## What is the Agent Manager?

Think of the Agent Manager as the **conductor of an orchestra** - it doesn't play any instruments itself, but it coordinates all the other AI agents to work together harmoniously. It's like having a smart project manager who ensures all your AI security experts are working in sync, sharing information, and delivering results efficiently.
